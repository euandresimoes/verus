# 📦 Verus CLI - The AI-Powered Commit Assistant

[🇺🇸 EN](https://github.com/euandresimoes/verus) | [🇧🇷 PT-BR](https://github.com/euandresimoes/verus/blob/master/README.pt-br.md)

**Verus** is a command-line tool (CLI) that integrates AI to automatically generate commit messages for your Git repositories. From a brief description of the changes made to the files, Verus uses OpenAI's API to suggest a formatted commit message, such as:

`✨ feat(auth/signup): implemented email verification`
